Source Code (Encrypt):
Just copy the Source Code of the applicaction, on any Python IDE, I'd recommend PyCharm, and run the code, and it will print the function using an input as a paremeter
 to ask you "What do you want to encrypt: ", then write the word or sentence you want to encrypt, and it will return the crypted word or sentence.

Source Code (Decrypt):
Almost the same as the function to encrypt, just copy the code on any Python IDE (PyCharm Recommended), and you can copy the crypted word or sentence that you get from
"Source Code (Encrypt)", and paste it in the intput that is inside the function as a paremeter, and like the other app, it will be automatically print the decrypted word 
or sentence
